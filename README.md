# World-Demographic-Analysis

The visualization design is based on the motivation of analyzing the change in world demographics over the past 50 years. This is a dynamic visualization design presenting the change in world demographics at a glance.

The main data source is from ‘World Demographics’ Kaggle website, which is a community of data scientists and machine learners. There were 4 datasets on metadata, population, fertility rate, and life expectancy in CSV format. For this visualization, we had to perform data manipulation such as join operation on datasets to create one master dataset and clean it by eliminating missing data. A major step in pre-processing the data was to convert the master dataset from wide to long format was accomplished by writing a code in R.

The main features of the design are: ● Dynamic visualization design ● Ability to understand the change in life expectancy with fertility rate for a period of over ~50 years and for several countries in one visualization design ● Ability to identify significant population sizes for different countries in different years ● Track the movement of countries over the year with respect to global health
